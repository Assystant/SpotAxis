"""
Django management command to create thumbnail images for files managed
by django-ckeditor's image browser.

This command scans all existing uploaded images and generates missing
thumbnail files. It is especially useful when integrating django-ckeditor
into a project with pre-existing uploaded images that lack thumbnails.

The command relies on the configured CKEDITOR_IMAGE_BACKEND to perform
thumbnail creation. If no backend is enabled, it exits gracefully.
