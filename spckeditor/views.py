"""
This module provides views and utility functions to handle image uploads and browsing
for CKEditor integration in a Django project.

Features:
- Secure image uploads with user-based directory restrictions.
- Image validation and thumbnail generation using CKEditor image backend.
- Recursive browsing of uploaded images with URL generation for display.
- Support for per-user upload directories controlled via settings.
- Integration with Django's default storage system for flexible file handling.

Includes:
- ImageUploadView: Class-based view to accept and process image uploads.
- Utility functions for filename generation, image file discovery, URL construction, and file type checks.
- A browse view rendering a gallery of uploaded images for user interaction.

Dependencies:
- Django framework (views, storage, settings).
- CKEditor Python package for image processing utilities.
