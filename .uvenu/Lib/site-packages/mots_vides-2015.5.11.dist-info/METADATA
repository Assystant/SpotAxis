        Usage
        =====
        
        Simple
        ------
        
        Better than a long speech, here a direct introduction: ::
        
          >>> from mots_vides import stop_words
        
          >>> english_stop_words = stop_words('en')
          >>> text = """
          ... Even though using "lorem ipsum" often arouses curiosity
          ... due to its resemblance to classical Latin,
          ... it is not intended to have meaning.
          ... """
        
          >>> print(english_stop_words.rebase(text))
          XXXX XXXXXX XXXXX "lorem ipsum" XXXXX arouses curiosity
          XXX XX XXX resemblance XX classical Latin,
          XX XX XXX intended XX XXXX meaning.
        
          >>> print(english_stop_words.rebase(text, '').split())
          ['"lorem', 'ipsum"', 'arouses', 'curiosity', 'resemblance',
          'classical', 'Latin,', 'intended', 'meaning.']
        
        Advanced
        --------
        
        *Mots vides* also provides two classes for managing the stop words in your
        language.
        
        ``StopWord`` which is a container for a collection of stop words.
        By default is language agnostic, but can be easily manipulated to create
        the collection: ::
        
          >>> from mots_vides import StopWord
        
          >>> french_stop_words = StopWord('french', ['le', 'la', 'les'])
          >>> french_stop_words += StopWord('french', ['un', 'une', 'des'])
          >>> french_stop_words += ['or', 'ni', 'car']
          >>> french_stop_words += 'assez'
          >>> french_stop_words += u'aussitôt'
          >>> print(sorted(french_stop_words))
          ['assez', u'aussitôt', 'car', 'des', 'la', 'le', 'les', 'ni', 'or', 'un', 'une']
        
        ``StopWordFactory`` is a factory for initializing ``StopWord`` objects by
        language and the appropriate collection of stop words. ::
        
          >>> from mots_vides import StopWordFactory
        
          >>> factory = StopWordFactory()
          >>> french_stop_words = factory.get_stop_words('french')
          >>> print(len(french_stop_words))
          577
        
        You can also use international language code to query a collection: ::
        
          >>> french_stop_words = factory.get_stop_words('fr')
          >>> print(len(french_stop_words))
          577
        
        If the required language does not exist a ``StopWordError`` is raised,
        unless the ``fail_safe`` parameter is set to ``True``: ::
        
          >>> klingon_stop_words = factory.get_stop_words('klingon')
          StopWordError: Stop words are not available in "klingon".
          >>> klingon_stop_words = factory.get_stop_words('klingon', fail_safe=True)
          >>> print(len(klingon_stop_words))
          0
