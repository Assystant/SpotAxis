    View function for displaying user activities and activity streams.
    
    This view handles both the activity stream for a user and individual activity details.
    It requires user authentication and proper company/recruiter association.
    The view supports two modes:
    1. Activity stream mode (when activity_id is None): Shows all activities where the user
       is either the actor or a subscriber
    2. Individual activity mode (when activity_id is provided): Shows a specific activity
       if the user has permission to view it
    
    Args:
        request (HttpRequest): The HTTP request object containing user and session data
        activity_id (int, optional): The ID of a specific activity to view. If None,
                                   shows the activity stream
    
    Returns:
        HttpResponse: Rendered template 'activities.html' with activity data
        
    Context:
        company (Company): The company associated with the current subdomain
        recruiter (Recruiter): The recruiter profile of the current user
        user (User): The current authenticated user
        activity_id (int): The ID of the activity being viewed (if any)
        activity_stream (QuerySet): The activities to be displayed
        
    Raises:
        Http404: If the company/subdomain is not found, the user is not a recruiter
                for the company, or the requested activity is not accessible
