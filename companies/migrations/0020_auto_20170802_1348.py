"""
Migration to alter the 'above_jobs' and 'below_jobs' fields in the Company model
to support optional (nullable) content and to explicitly define their default as empty.
"""

class Migration(migrations.Migration):
    """
    Updates the 'above_jobs' and 'below_jobs' fields of the Company model:

    - Both fields now allow null values (`null=True`), meaning they can be left unset in the database.
    - Both fields are now explicitly allowed to be blank in forms (`blank=True`), which helps during form validation.
    - The default value for both fields is set to an empty byte string (`b''`), though this behaves similarly to an empty string.

    These changes enhance the flexibility and robustness of these fields for use cases where 
    additional content is not always required above or below job listings.
