test_ticket_lookup.py

This module tests public ticket lookup functionality in the Django Helpdesk app.
It focuses on how users (typically ticket submitters) can access their tickets via:

- Direct database ID lookup
- Public view URL (usually emailed to submitters)
- Old links remaining functional even if the ticket's queue changes

These tests ensure robust public access behavior independent of the knowledge base setting.
