    """
    Migration to create the QueueMembership model linking users to authorized queues.

    This migration depends on the Django user model (which may be swappable) and a
    previous helpdesk migration '0003_initial_data_import'. It defines a new model
    `QueueMembership` that associates a user with one or more helpdesk queues they
    are authorized to access.

    Attributes:
        dependencies (list): List of migration dependencies that must be applied before this migration.
        operations (list): List of migration operations, here creating the QueueMembership model.

    Model: QueueMembership
    Fields:
        id (AutoField): Primary key for the model, automatically created.
        queues (ManyToManyField): Many-to-many relationship to the 'Queue' model, representing authorized queues.
        user (OneToOneField): One-to-one relationship to the user model, representing the user owning this membership.

    Meta Options:
        verbose_name (str): Human-readable singular name for the model.
        verbose_name_plural (str): Human-readable plural name for the model.
