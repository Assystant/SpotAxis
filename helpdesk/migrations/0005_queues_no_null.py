    Migration to update ManyToManyField definitions on several models related to queues.

    This migration modifies the 'queues' field in the following models: 
    - EscalationExclusion
    - IgnoreEmail
    - PresetReply

    Each altered field now includes a help text explaining that leaving the field blank
    means the entry applies to all queues, while selecting specific queues limits
    the effect to those queues only.

    Attributes:
        dependencies (list): List of migration dependencies that must be applied before this migration.
        operations (list): List of migration operations altering fields in the specified models.

    Operations:
        AlterField for 'queues' on:
            - EscalationExclusion: ManyToManyField to 'Queue' with a descriptive help_text.
            - IgnoreEmail: ManyToManyField to 'Queue' with a descriptive help_text.
            - PresetReply: ManyToManyField to 'Queue' with a descriptive help_text.
