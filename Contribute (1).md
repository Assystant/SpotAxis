# 🛠️ **How to Contribute** {#🛠️-how-to-contribute}

1. **Review the Code of Conduct:** Please read and adhere to our Code of Conduct to maintain a welcoming environment for all contributors.

2. **Search Existing Issues:** Before opening a new issue, search both open and closed issues to avoid duplicates.

3. **Open a New Issue:** If your concern isn’t already reported, open an issue using GitHub’s issue form and fill out all required fields—this helps us help you faster.

4. **Fork and Clone the Repository:** This keeps your work organized and isolated.

5. **Create a Branch:** Branch from `main` with a descriptive name (e.g., `feat/new-auth-flow` or `fix/login-bug`).

6. **Implement Your Changes:** Follow existing code style, add or update tests, and ensure new code is covered by tests.

7. **Run Tests and Linters:** Install dependencies (`npm install` or `pip install -r requirements.txt`), run the test suite (`npm test` or `pytest`), and fix any linting errors (ESLint, Prettier, Flake8).

8. **Commit and Push:** Use clear, imperative-style commit messages (see below), reference the related issue number, then push your branch to your fork.

9. **Open a Pull Request:** Target the `main` branch of `Assystant/SpotAxis`, use our PR template, link the issue (if any), summarize your changes, and include screenshots or recordings for UI updates.

10. **Respond to Feedback:** Maintain an open dialogue; address review comments promptly and update your PR until it’s ready to merge.

# ✅ **Do’s and Don’ts**  **Do** {#✅-do’s-and-don’ts-do}

* Follow the Code of Conduct at all times

* Search for existing issues before creating new ones

* Write focused, self-contained pull requests with a single purpose

* Include tests for new features or bug fixes

* Keep commit messages clear, concise, and in imperative mood

* Run the full test suite and linters locally before submitting

**Don’t**

* Submit large, monolithic PRs without prior discussion

* Combine formatting changes with functional changes in the same commit

* Push code that fails tests or linting checks

* Include sensitive information (passwords, API keys) in issues or code

* Ignore or dismiss reviewer feedback—collaboration is iterative

# 💻 **Code Style**  {#💻-code-style}

Consistency is the most important thing in SpotAxis. Always match the existing style, formatting, and naming conventions of the file you’re touching and the project as a whole—this keeps reviews focused on functionality rather than superficial tweaks.

For example, if private properties are prefixed with an underscore (`_userData`), please continue that pattern for any new properties you add. If methods use camelCase (`thisIsMyNewMethod`), don’t switch to snake\_case (`this_is_my_new_method`). When in doubt, skim nearby code or ask in a PR comment for guidance.

Whenever possible, style and formatting will be enforced automatically with our configured linter, so be sure to run it locally before committing.

---

# ✍️ **Commit Message Guidelines** {#✍️-commit-message-guidelines}

1. **Subject line** in imperative mood, ≤ 50 characters (e.g., “Add timeout to login”)

2. **Blank line** separating subject from body

3. **Body** explains *why* the change was needed; wrap lines at 72 characters

4. **No period** at end of subject line

5. **Reference** the issue number when applicable

---

# 🐞 **Bug & Feature Request Guidelines**  Before filing or reviewing a request: {#🐞-bug-&-feature-request-guidelines-before-filing-or-reviewing-a-request:}

* Confirm you’re on the latest SpotAxis release

* Search existing issues to avoid duplicates

* Fill out all required fields in GitHub’s issue form for clarity and context

* We’ll label issues as “bug,” “enhancement,” or “documentation,” and may ask for additional details (environment, reproduction steps)
